Week of 9/9:
App updated to connect to C5545 DSP board
Ongoing work to switch to from Raspberry Pi to TI Launchpad/Boosterpack



Week of 9/16:

Mobile Application (Aaron Smith):
Working on reading current battery level to display to GUI
Signals can be sent from Samsung Galaxy S8 to BoosterPack, need to be able to read signals from BoosterPack on Launchpad to
 enable/disable effects

Digital Signal Processing (Adrian Hernandez):
Switch from Raspberry Pi to TI Launchpad almost complete. Sampling analog signal with 14-bit resolution 
at 50k samples per second. It is much better than what could be achieved with the RPi. What's next is 
integrating Aaron's Bluetooth software to control effects. The software will check for an input from the Bluetooth module 
periodically (every second or less). Then the data will be sent to the audio out on the BoosterPack.

Analog Amplification (John Cain):
Waiting on PCB to be printed to solder (request sent)
Integrating w/ power subsystem using old PCB (until new one is processed)
Working on physical integration while waiting for new PCB

Power Subsystem (Samuel DeHoyos):
Power distribution designed and prepared for other subsytems using low power power distribution block and converters
from last semester.
Moving forward, I am going to work on designing the housing for all electrical components in the backpack and find a solution
to mounting the solar panels onto the front of the backpack. In addition to this, I will also be trying to help my team 
members with their subsystems.



Week of 9/23:
Mobile Application (Aaron Smith):


Digital Signal Processing (Adrian Hernandez):
Still working on communication between Launchpad and BoosterPack. 
To be completed by next week.


Analog Amplification (John Cain):
Waiting on PCB order to be processed still
Still finalizing integration with power subsystem


Power Subsystem (Samuel DeHoyos):
Nearly ready to put order in for power distribution block. Power system ready and waiting for integration.
Solution to solar panel mounting found, going to create separate housing sleeve that will connect to backpack; this bypasses
the need for mounting the panels directly onto the backpack and also gives the user the ability to use the panels off of the
backpack.
